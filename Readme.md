Produce a simple React Native app that retrieves and lists the players/drivers for two of your
favourite teams - the results should be displayed in a two column grid layout and we should
be able to view details of each player when tapping on them in the list view.
Some bonus points if we can filter between the teams, see images of the players/drives and
if we are are able to favourite players/drivers (this can be persisted on the device)
